	a. First window is initiated from the root directory. Run: babel src/app.js --out-file=public/scripts/app.js --presets=env,react --watch
	b. Second window is initiated from the /public directory. Run: live-server

2. When that is done a Chrome window opens to 127.0.0.1:8080 and your Indecision App is on screen and any changes you make will live reload.

3. Lifecycle methods are not available in stateless functional components. If you need them you have to use a class based component.
